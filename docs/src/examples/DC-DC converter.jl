# # Example: DC-DC converter
#
# We consider the problem of a DCDC convertor.
# In order to study the concrete system and its symbolic abstraction in a unified framework, we will solve the problem
# for the sampled system with a sampling time $\tau$.
#
# The abstraction is based on a feedback refinment relation [4,V.2 Definition].
# Basically, this is equivalent to an alternating simulation relationship with the additional constraint that the input of the
# concrete and symbolic system preserving the relation must be identical.
# This allows to easily determine the controller of the concrete system from the abstraction controller by simply adding a quantization step.
#
# For the construction of the relations in the abstraction, it is necessary to over-approximate attainable sets of
# a particular cell. In this example, we consider the used of a growth bound function  [4, VIII.2, VIII.5] which is one of the possible methods to over-approximate
# attainable sets of a particular cell based on the state reach by its center. Therefore, it is used
# to compute the relations in the abstraction based on the feedback refinement relation.
#

# First, let us import [StaticArrays](https://github.com/JuliaArrays/StaticArrays.jl).

using StaticArrays

# At this point, we import the useful Dionysos sub-module for this problem: [Abstraction](@__REPO_ROOT_URL__/src/Abstraction/abstraction.jl).
using Dionysos
const DI = Dionysos
const UT = DI.Utils
const DO = DI.Domain
const ST = DI.System
const CO = DI.Control
const SY = DI.Symbolic

# ### Definition of the system
# we can import the module containing the DCDC problem like this 
include(joinpath(dirname(dirname(pathof(Dionysos))), "problems", "DCDC.jl"))
@doc DCDC.system

# and we can instantiate the DC system with the provided system
contsys=DCDC.system()

#The default values are included, but can be changed. 
DCDC.solveproblem(contsys) 

# ### Trajectory display
# We choose the number of steps `nsteps` for the sampled system, i.e. the total elapsed time: `nstep`*`tstep`
# as well as the true initial state `x0` which is contained in the initial state-space defined previously.
#nstep = 300;
#x0 = SVector(1.2, 5.6);
# To complete
